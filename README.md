# Git Branching :

Created a Master branch and kept up to date with latest development.

Created development branch to mock real world VCS behaviour

Committed and Pushed my latest code to the development branch and later merged to master branch.

Both the branches are up to date with latest changes.

Used source tree and command prompt both to push latest codes.



# Note :

I have created some empty folders like requests , extensions etc , This is only for presentation purposes. In a real project we need all these folders to keep the project neat and maintainable.

I have Inspected my code through lint, I have resolved everything except 3 warnings , Intentionally I kept as it is because I don't want to delete those unused classes. I want it for a presentational purpose. It will be used when its requirement arises.

I will optimize the code wherever required.
